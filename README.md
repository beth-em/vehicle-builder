# VEHICLE BUILDER

## Description
Vehicle Builder is a command-line application where users can create and interact with different types of vehicles such as, cars, trucks and motorbikes. Users have the option to create a new vehicle or select an existing one and perform various actions on it within the CLI.

## User Story
* As a user, I can create a new vehicle or select an existing one.
* As a user, I can input vehicle details such as make, model, year, weight and topspeed.
* As a user, I can perform actions on the vehicle and see the results in the CLI.
* As a user, I can continue to interact with the vehicle until I decide to exit the application.

## Installation
On GitHub, you can clone the repository and create a new directory in your terminal. Once you have a project directory, navigate to that project and open VS Code. Once VS Code is up and running, install dependencies by running "npm install".

## Usage
First, we will build our project by running "npm run build", then start the application "npm run start" and follow the CLI prompts to begin creating or modifying an existing vehicle. Prompts also include: "Choose between a car, truck or motorbike", "Enter vehicle details", "Perform actions with the vehicle", "View action results in the terminal" and "Repeat actions or exit when done".

## Expected Behavior
